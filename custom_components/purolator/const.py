# Every value not listed here comes back as a literal ``None`` from
# normalize_parcel(). The docs site's carrier comparison table is generated
# straight from this constant, so keep it in agreement with parcels.py.
# ``dimensions`` is never exposed by the endpoint.
CAPABILITIES = frozenset({"weight", "delivery_window", "url", "history"})

# Fields whose support is not confirmed yet — typically a carrier built without
# a real parcel to check against. Leave this empty once the open questions are
# answered. A field is in exactly one of three states: in CAPABILITIES (seen
# populated), in PENDING_CAPABILITIES (docs site shows "awaiting data"), or in
# neither (the API never exposes it). Pending fields must still come back as a
# literal ``None`` from normalize_parcel() until they are confirmed and moved
# into CAPABILITIES. A multi-backend carrier declares
# PENDING_CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT with the same keys as its
# CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT instead (omit backends with nothing pending).
# Only a home-delivered parcel has been seen; a parcel waiting at a pickup
# location may carry the location in the response.
PENDING_CAPABILITIES = frozenset({"pickup_point"})

# If this carrier ever grows a second backend with a genuinely different
# payload shape (a country-specific API, not just a config option), replace
# the single CAPABILITIES above with a CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT dict instead:
#
#   CAPABILITIES_BY_VARIANT = {
#       "Germany": frozenset({"pickup_point", "url", "history"}),
#       "Other": frozenset({"weight", "dimensions", "delivery_window",

#   }
#
# Key order is display order on the docs site's comparison table; label each
# key exactly as the carrier's own country/backend selector does. The docs
# site's generator accepts either shape — don't declare both. Do not add this
# preemptively: a single-backend carrier (the common case) keeps the flat
# CAPABILITIES above.
